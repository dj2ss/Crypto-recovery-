# 💸 Crypto Recovery Bounty – $4,000 Reward

## ❗ What Happened

I was scammed by a **Ponzi scheme** website that tricked me into depositing a significant amount of cryptocurrency.  
The total loss is approximately **$8,000 USD**.

I'm now looking for an **ethical hacker, blockchain analyst, or recovery expert** who might be able to help **trace, freeze, or recover** the stolen funds through legal and technical means.

## 📌 Details

I understand that recovery might not always be guaranteed, but I'm willing to **pay for serious effort** and real technical attempts.

## 🎁 Bounty

💰 **$4,000 USD Reward** (in USDT / BTC / ETH) for successful recovery or actionable lead that results in partial or full fund recovery.  
Partial bounty available for **useful forensic investigation, address tracing, or exchange contact info**.
